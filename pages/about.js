                This app was created as a fun project that exercies the use of the Sanity.io CMS to easily produce
                and update posts and serve them from an API. It&apos;s built using ReactJS, NextJS, and TailwindCSS.

                In addition to learning how to use Content Management Systems, I&apos;m able to
                express my love for movie-watching, comicbook collecting, 
                and general breakdowns for topics I&apos;m passionate about. This project is a fantastic way to practice and illustrate 
                the most effective means to leverage my knowledge of ReactJS, NextJS, and a headless CMS to better understand how 
                easy it can be to create a site with readily accessible content.

                As far as app usage goes, this app is built solely out of interest in blogging my innermost thoughts on certain suibjects
                and sholdn&apos;t be taken seriously in any manner! It&apos;s only a fun project with which I aim to increase my skills and 
                may someday expand upon this app to further increase it&apos;s functionality. Perhaps I&apos;ll add the ability to like and
                comment on blog posts? Only time will tell!
